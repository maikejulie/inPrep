# publications
A collection of miscellaneous papers I am involved in. Please contact me with any questions. Some papers published, in preparation, submitted, in review or otherwise in the works. Comments, discussion and opinions much appreciated!

I will upload work in progress where results could be of interest to others, and appreciate feedback. Be aware that this is preliminary work either in review or being reworked. For newer versions feel free to contact me.

News: Linear predictability of SSH paper now available on line!
